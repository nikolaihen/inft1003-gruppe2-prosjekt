      To play Globethrotter, you need access to a computer. In order to play, you need both a keyboard and a mouse connected to your computer. The game has a shallow learning curve, meaning that anyone at any age can start playing and get good at the game reasonably fast. The goal of the game is to get as high score as you possibly can, and you achieve this by getting as high up as possible without taking too much damage from hitting the platforms or falling to your death.
